# Astronaut Database Exploration

## Dataset

This database contains publically available information 
about all astronauts who participated in space missions 
before 15 January 2020 collected from NASA, Roscosmos, 
and fun-made websites. The provided information includes full astronaut name, 
sex, date of birth, nationality, military status, a title and year of a selection program, 
and information about each mission completed by a particular astronaut such as a year, ascend 
and descend shuttle names, mission and extravehicular activity (EVAs) 
durations.[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-14/astronauts.csv),
with feature documentation available [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-14/readme.md).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the vast majority of astronauts are males with 1134 male 
astronauts 88.8% compared to just 143 female astronauts 11.1%, and 60% of astronauts have 
a military background and 40% are civilians. I also analyzed the relationship between multiple 
variables and I learned that the U.S. And U.S.S.R/Russia is the countries with most space missions,
During the analysis I found out that On average, female astronauts were 
younger than their male counterpart, and the median age for females is around 
31 years and the median age for males is around 33.5 years, however, male astronauts 
have a large range in age and the oldest astronaut in the selection years was 60 years old.
After digging deeper into the data we can see in recent years that female astronauts spending 
more time in the missions indicating that female astronauts are taking some leading positions in 
recent years compared to the early years of the space program.When it comes to the nations, from early 
on to the recent years the U.S. and U.S.S.R/Russia is making most missions in space, however, Russia is 
still spending more time than the U.S. in the missions, but other nations are starting to 
catch up with the U.S. And Russia and starting to make more longer missions to the space. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I only put the most significant findings from the data with the right kind 
of plot to make a clear physician to better communicate the message, for the first visualization 
titled "Gender Disparities in Astronomy", I used the count plot 
to see the difference between the Genders and I was clear how males are 
more than females in the data.For the second fixation titled "Gender Disparities in the Missions Over the Years", 
I used barplot to with different colors for each gender over the years to see how many of each gender for every given year, 
and its very clear and easy to see and understand visualization.
The third visualization titled "The Gender Gap in the Missions Over the Years", The time series 
here makes more sense about the change over time when it comes to the activity of female astronauts over time 
Compared to males, indicating that female astronauts are taking some leading positions in recent years compared 
to the early years of the space program.
